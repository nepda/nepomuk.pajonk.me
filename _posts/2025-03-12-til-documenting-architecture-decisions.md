# Documenting Architecture Decisions with ADRs

Today I re-read [the article by Michael Nygard, Documenting Architecture Decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
and wanted to mention it in my TILs.

* An ADR is like a conversation with a future developer on the project.
* "A new person coming on to a project may be perplexed, baffled, delighted, or infuriated by some past decision."
* The motivation behind certain decisions and impact for future development.
