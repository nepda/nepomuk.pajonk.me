# Prevent unfinished code

I'm the only person who sees my technical dept.

Code: "This is my personal brand."

"If you don't have time to do it right the first time, what makes you think you'll have time to redo it."  I had that quote on my whiteboard for years.

# Enforce coding standards

Use tools to enforce and establish coding standards.

Use public standards.

# Document chosen patterns

Use a document to list all the patterns and decisions used.

# Review new patterns early

Show new patterns to the team. Maybe it was for a good reason, not to adapt it.

# Never expose refactoring

Don't put in the ticket system.

"Anything you put in as an individual item that your management can see is something they can take out."

We as developers have to take responsibility for quality.

# Assume unexpected change

For estimation, add extra time.

# Other notes

Notice the keyword being "software" and not "code" because software is more than just code - it's the documentation, 
communication, refactoring and timely delivery of that code.
